# 📄 MT564 Event Processing Service

This Spring Boot microservice processes streaming MT564 event data, persists only changed records, and maintains field-level version history for audit and delta tracking.

---

## 🧩 Overview

The system ingests corporate action events (MT564) from an upstream source via a scheduled job. It processes and stores only the changed records in a Oracle database, maintaining historical snapshots for every version. Field-level deltas can be queried via a REST API for downstream reporting or reconciliation.
